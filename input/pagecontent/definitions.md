## Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
|Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) | A standards organization creating standards for medical devices|
|Channel | Umbrella object in the object model that groups together physiological measurement data and data derived from these data. (IEE 11073-10201 DIM)|
| Domain Information Model (DIM) | In IEEE 11073 specifically, it is the model specified by IEEE 11073-10201.|
| International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) | International standards group, which, among many other things, creates safety, effectiveness, and security standards for medical devices.|
